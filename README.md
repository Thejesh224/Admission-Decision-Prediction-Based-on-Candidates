# **🎓 Admission Decision Prediction Based on Candidate Academic and Work Profiles**

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting MBA admission decisions using candidate academic scores and work experience. The analysis aims to understand which factors contribute most to successful admissions and build a model capable of classifying candidates based on their profiles.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

* Analyze how GMAT, GPA, and work experience influence admission outcomes.
* Visualize trends and differences between admitted and non-admitted candidates.
* Build a classification model to predict admission decisions.
* Identify key features that impact admission likelihood.

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

* **🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy)**
* **🤖 Scikit-Learn**
* **📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn**
* **💻 Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

---

## 📁 **Dataset**

The dataset includes:

* **GMAT Score**
* **GPA**
* **Work Experience (in years)**
* **Admission Status (0 = Not Admitted, 1 = Admitted)**

This combination helps analyze both academic and professional attributes of candidates.

---

## 🔍 **Key Insights**

* Higher GMAT scores and GPA generally increase the chances of admission.
* Candidates with more work experience tend to have better acceptance rates.
* The model successfully identifies patterns that differentiate admitted candidates from non-admitted ones.
